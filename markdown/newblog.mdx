description: Migrating to a new blog format.
---

We have migrated from blog.atl.tools to a blog baked into our website!

We rely on the [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) format for our blog posts as well as remark and rehype plugins to enhance the markdown experience.

You can use **markdown** syntax as well as **React components** in your blog posts.

```py "fancy"
print("You can also use fancy code blocks in your blog posts.")
```
