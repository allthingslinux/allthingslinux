@everyone

### **IRC and XMPP Services are Back Online!**

but unfortunately if you had an existing account, you will need to register again.

### **Exciting News!**

- **New Domain for Chat Services:**  
  Weâ€™ve acquired [https://atl.chat/](https://atl.chat/) for all chat-related services! Maybe a Matrix homeserver in the future?
- **Connection Details:**
  - **IRC:** `irc.atl.chat` | Port: `6697` (TLS/SSL) | Channel: `#general`
  - **XMPP:** `atl.chat` | Room: `general@muc.atl.chat`

### **Domain Acquisition:**

And lastly, we are very happy to announce that we are being gifted the domain [https://allthingslinux.com/](https://allthingslinux.com/) from a veteran Linux user who wasn't using it anymore so there are exciting opportunities ahead there! Transfer is currently in progress so you may see something non related currently.

### **P.S.:**

We might be opening up our **ATL email service** soon! ðŸ˜‰
