### **📚 Introducing the All Things Linux Wiki!**  

We’ve been exploring the idea of creating a **wiki/resource hub** with the domain **allthingslinux.dev**, and we’d love your feedback!  

---  

#### **Why Create a Wiki?**  
The goal is to build a resource that helps new users with common Linux questions and problems, such as:  
- **"What [distro/DE/WM] should I pick?"**  
- Troubleshooting **Nvidia driver issues**  
- **Ricing essentials** and best practices  
- **Migrating to Wayland** from X11  

Imagine the value we could create by summarizing solutions from ⁠**#support-forum** posts into concise, digestible content! We could also compile a curated list of key applications, guides, and resources.  

Even better, what about creating a **learning roadmap** to guide beginners through essential Linux topics? The possibilities are endless!

Let us know your thoughts and ideas—we’re excited to collaborate with you all to create something amazing! 🐧
