#  **Contest Time... Kinda?!**  

Hello, @everyone!  

We’re on the hunt for a new **logo** for **All Things Linux** or simply **"ATL"**, and I’m inviting you to get creative and contribute your ideas!  

---

## **What’s the Challenge?**  
I’ve been brainstorming logo concepts for quite a while but haven’t landed on something that feels just right. Now, I’m opening it up to the community to see what you can create!  

---

## **Rewards**  
- **$100** to the designer of a logo that I truly love.  

*Note*: There’s no strict time limit for this contest, so take your time to craft something amazing. A thread will be opened here for submissions.

## **Important Details**  
- **Purpose**: This logo will represent our entire organization—on our website, social media, branding materials, and more.  
- **Style Tip**:  
  - Always design logos in **black and white** first.  
  - Ensure the logo works on both **black** and **white** backgrounds.  
- **Technical Requirements**:  
  - The logo must be in **VECTOR format** (e.g., SVG, AI, EPS).  
  - It should account for sizing constraints and scalability.  
- **AI Usage**:  
  - **AI-generated logos are NOT allowed.**  
  - Using AI for inspiration or brainstorming is fine.
