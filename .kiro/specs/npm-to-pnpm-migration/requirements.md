# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the AllThingsLinux project from npm to pnpm as the package manager. The migration should maintain all existing functionality while leveraging pnpm's benefits including faster installs, better disk space efficiency, and stricter dependency resolution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use pnpm instead of npm for package management, so that I can benefit from faster installs and better dependency management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is cloned THEN pnpm SHALL be used for all package management operations
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN pnpm SHALL create a pnpm-lock.yaml file instead of package-lock.json
3. WHEN scripts are run THEN they SHALL work identically to the current npm-based setup
4. WHEN the project is built THEN all build processes SHALL complete successfully with pnpm

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing npm scripts to work with pnpm, so that the development workflow remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running development commands THEN pnpm run dev SHALL start the development server
2. WHEN running build commands THEN pnpm run build SHALL create production builds
3. WHEN running deployment commands THEN pnpm run deploy SHALL deploy the application
4. WHEN running utility scripts THEN all npm scripts SHALL work with pnpm equivalents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper pnpm configuration, so that the package manager works optimally for this project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pnpm is configured THEN it SHALL respect the existing .npmrc settings where applicable
2. WHEN pnpm installs packages THEN it SHALL use the correct Node.js version specified in engines
3. WHEN pnpm manages dependencies THEN it SHALL maintain the same dependency versions as npm
4. WHEN pnpm is used THEN it SHALL be configured for optimal performance and compatibility

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing documentation to be updated to reflect pnpm usage, so that setup instructions remain accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN README.md SHALL show pnpm commands instead of npm
2. WHEN setup instructions exist THEN they SHALL reference pnpm installation and usage
3. WHEN package management commands are documented THEN they SHALL use pnpm syntax

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration to be safe and maintain compatibility, so that no functionality is broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are migrated THEN no package versions SHALL be unintentionally changed
2. WHEN the migration is tested THEN all existing functionality SHALL work identically
3. WHEN issues are encountered THEN git version control SHALL allow quick reversion
