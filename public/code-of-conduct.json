  "content": "# Code of Conduct\n\n## Preface\n\n### Discord Community Guidelines and Terms of Service\n\nYour presence in this server implies accepting Discord’s Community Guidelines and Terms of Service, including all further changes. These changes might be done at any time with or without notice, it is your responsibility to consistently review and follow them.\nIf something major is missing, it's likely within Discord's ToS and/or Discord Community Guidelines, and will be mentioned as such in cases where it applies.\n\n- [Discord Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)\n- [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)\n\n## Section 1. Essentials\n### 1.1. Appropriate Conduct and SFW Policy\nThis is a Safe for Work (SFW) environment, which strictly prohibits Not Safe for Work (NSFW) content and discussions. NSFW usually refers to sexually explicit content, however the definition is expanding to include a broader range of sensitive topics over time. Although Discord allows servers to create designated NSFW channels, this server doesn’t offer such channels.\n\n1.1.a - Do not share, portray, or discuss NSFW (or otherwise inappropriate) topics in the server or in your profile. This includes, but isn't limited to:\n* Messages and media within the server, including emojis and stickers\n* Anything portrayed on your profile (i.e About Me, profile picture, banner, status, and guild tag)\n\n1.1.b - Do not share media depicting, glorifying, or promoting gore, excessive violence, animal abuse, suicide, or self-harm. Excessive violence, for the purposes of this Code of Conduct, is defined as content that includes but isn't limited to:\n* Real-life imagery, including gore, severe injury or death.\n* Violent fictional content.\n* Any media that is intended to shock, disturb or incite harm.\n\n\n\n### 1.2. Mutual Respect\nOur server prioritizes respect for each other above all else.\n\nMaintain a respectful and humble attitude in all interactions. Avoid displaying unwarranted arrogance or belittling others. Any form of discrimination towards other members based on their unique characteristics is strictly prohibited. Unique characteristics are, but aren't limited to: race, age, gender, sexual orientation, and religion.\n\nThreats, regardless of whether they are direct, indirect, or implied, will not be tolerated. Conspiracy theories are also prohibited. \n\nMembers should also avoid disparaging others on the basis of their choices, be it their choice of operating system, desktop environment, or other interests outside the main topics of the server. While friendly rivalry and banter can be elements of online communities, we don't welcome deliberate and obnoxious elitism. Respect for each other's preferences and diversity is a cardinal rule in our server.\n\n\n\n### 1.3. Controversial, Sensitive and Unfit Topics\nMembers are free to express themselves and offer constructive criticism and input. We celebrate and encourage our diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and opinions.\nHowever, this community upholds a model of responsible communication. While we encourage discussions, we urge members to refrain from initiating sensitive and/or controversial topics that might trigger conflict, perpetuate hatred, or incite violence.\n\nAvoid offering or seeking professional advice, including but isn't limited to medical, legal, therapeutic, religious, or financial matters.\n\nDo not share media or messages depicting harmful or offensive language and/or content. \n\nControversial topics are defined as subjects that commonly spark debate and conflict. These include, but not limited to:\n* Politics\n* Religious belief systems and practices\n* Ongoing global conflicts and war\n* Sensitive historical topics \n\nSensitive topics are defined as subjects that commonly trigger, distress, or in some way disturb others. These include, but not limited to:\n* Excessive emotional oversharing (commonly known as traumadumping)\n* Common phobia-inducing content without spoiler & warning\n* Display, act, or discussion of drug use\n\nHowever, bear in mind that if any conversation is overly repetitive, heated, disruptive, toxic, or indecent, moderators have the discretion to intervene, redirect, advise, or halt the conversation. These terms are not limited to a specific conversation but the mentioning of said topic. Our aim is not to suppress free speech but to keep an appropriate chatroom while promoting open, respectful, and harmonious conversations among all members.\n\n\n\n### 1.4. Respecting Authority & Rules\nAs we are a large and growing community, we ask for you to be cooperative and avoid disruption when it comes to moderation. Please respect the privacy of others and confidentiality of some moderation duties. In the aim of transparency, we also provide public logs if you wish to view them.\n\nWe ask for you to not comment on ongoing, recently resolved situations, or especially ask questions like “what happened?” when a situation is serious. Other disruptive behavior in this regard include:\n* Screenshots and forwarding of audit logs in public chats\n* Bumping rulebreaking messages via reply, especially after a moderator is dealing with it\n* Mini modding\n* Jokes to do with someone being moderated (including being witty or spiteful)\n* Pinging the moderation team (including %wheel) for no reason\n\n\n\n\n## Section 2. Participation\n### 2.1. Language Requirement: English Only\nThe language used in this server is English only. Please use English in text, voice, and support channels.\n\n\n\n### 2.2. Server Conduct\nAll server rules apply in every channel, including both text and voice.\n\n2.2.a - Chat Quality\n\nAvoid spam, low-effort or “brainrot” messages (often abbreviated to LQ or low quality), incoherent text, animal sounds, disruptive speech, or otherwise obnoxious behavior. Contribute meaningfully and with substantial value.\n\n2.2.b – Voice Channels\n\nEtiquette in voice chat is different from how text may be approached, but please keep these in mind:\n* Keep noise minimal (mute when afk, minimize yelling and echoing)\n* Use side chat for notes and discussion instead of a regular channel\n* Don’t interrupt or dominate discussions\n* Avoid skipping, disconnecting, or otherwise tampering with a music bot in use\n\n2.2.c – Channel Use\n\nPlease stay on topic and in the right channel. Check channel description if you’re unsure. \nAvoid misusing bots and applications. Bots should be in #dj-booth, #bot-commands, or side chats.\nAvoid derailing ongoing discussions and misusing channels that have a specific purpose, such as the support channels. \nModerators may suddenly change topics only in cases where it’s on the verge of being rule-breaking.\n\n\n\n### 2.3. Malicious and Illegal Behavior\nDiscussions about cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and related topics are allowed strictly for educational and informational purposes. Any form of illegal activity or harmful behavior is strictly prohibited.\n* Do not plan or discuss attempts to raid other servers\n* Do not scam, hack, dox members, or make attempts at such\n* Do not share, request access to, or distribute pirated software, media, or copyrighted content\n* Do not discuss or promote software cracking, DRM bypassing, or any methods of copyright circumvention\n* Do not encourage illegal actions or behavior\n* Do not send anything that can harm other people's devices\n\n\n\n### 2.4. Advertising\nPromotion of websites, products, services, and projects are only permitted if shared in a natural manner. \nCommunities should only be promoted if relevant to the conversation, or related to an existing project (such as Arch, Debian, and Fedora). \n\nIn cases where promotion is artificial, please see our Projects forum. \n\nAny sort of financial gain such as freelancing and bounties are strictly forbidden.\n\n\n\n\n## Section 3. Moderation\n### 3.1. Reporting\nModerators are here to help. If there is a non-urgent problem that needs moderator attention, please create a ticket. Otherwise, ping the \\`%wheel\\` role. Any and all problems are discussed as a group among moderators. Remember, nothing can be reported without concrete proof. Reporting because of rumors or hearsay is not acceptable proof. Please provide context, and searchable/linkable information as well as identifying information such as member IDs.\n\nWe use tickets as a way to both provide a private channel to safely report things and to provide team transparency. Tickets are also logged to ensure everything is logged and accounted for in the case that we need to reference things in the future. \n\n\n\n### 3.2. Accountability\nAll rules apply to all members, including staff. If the community has reason to believe the owner is unfit for ownership due to breaching any rules defined in this document or misusing the server outside of what is listed, the community may request for ownership to be removed and changed.\n\n\n\n### 3.3. Transparency\nAudit logs are visible to all server members. Audit logs contain a history of all changes and actions within the server as well as all moderator actions such as punishments given to members.\n\nWe also have donations publicly visible via OpenCollective.\n\n\n\n### 3.4. Enforcement\nEnforcement of these rules may be done through different means. Listed below are the typical forms.\n\n#### Case by Case\n\nWith Case by Case moderation, punishment is more subjective and dependent on the nature and frequency of transgressions. While this system gives moderators a large amount of flexibility, accountability can be difficult due to the lack of standards and certain moderators may punish members differently. All actions can be reviewed by another member of staff upon request by a member.\n\n#### Automod\n\nBasic auto moderation will exist in this server to prevent universally severe and hateful or offensive language. If auto moderation prevents natural discussion at any point, report the issue via ticket. Additionally, basic safety and security precautions will exist to filter out harmful links and material shared within this server.\n\n\n\n### 3.5. Punishment\n#### 3.5.a - Moderator Privileges\nIf a member is found breaking any of these rules, moderators reserve the right to give any of the following punishments depending on the severity of the offense:\n\n* **Warnings**\n  * Warnings act as a permanent history for members and their behavior. Warnings should be descriptive and provide context or reason.\n* **Timeouts**\n  * Timeouts act as a temporary safeguard against in-the-moment disruption of the server and allow members to \"cool off\" until they mitigate the current situation with a moderator.\n* **Jail**\n  * Jail is often used to hold a member temporarily, especially if a situation is ongoing. It’s used as a way to let members cool off, wait for a ticket to be made, and/or handle things without disrupting chat. Jails are also used if a member doesn’t answer their ticket after 48 hours.\n* **Snippetban**\n  * Snippetbans are a punishment that can be temporary or permanent and prevents a member from creating or managing snippets.\n* **Pollban**\n  * Pollbans are a punishment that can be temporary or permanent and prevents a member from creating polls.\n* **Kicks**\n  * Kicks are typically not used within this server due to the way rule breaking is handled.\n* **Bans**\n  * Bans may either act as a temporary punishment for an allotted time frame based on the severity of the offense and the offender's history or as a permanent punishment.\n\n#### 3.5.b - Administrator Privileges\nAdministrators outline and uphold our standards.\n\n* **Dispute regarding conduct**\n  * Administrators are permitted to resolve disputes regarding the Code of Conduct by using context, perspective and interpretation to ensure order.\n* **Internal and External**\n  * Administrators are permitted to investigate internal and external interests and speak for the organization.\n\n#### 3.5.c - Problematic Behavior\nIf a member is deemed problematic, moderators reserve the right to punish members more strictly. This includes “final warnings” and, in severe cases, bans. \n\nProblematic behavior can be defined by a variety of factors. This includes, but not limited to:\n* Lengthy moderation logs, including verbal warns\n* Extensive ticket history\n* Constantly “pushing the line” of rules\n* Lack of improvement from previous punishments\n* Members recognized to be problematic in other spaces (crossbans)\n\n\n\n### 3.6. Punishment Evasion\nMembers should not attempt to evade the consequences of their actions by bypassing restrictions. Punishment evasion will result in an immediate ban.\n\nEvasion includes, but not limited to:\n* Using an alternative account\n* Leaving and rejoining the server\n\n\n\n### 3.7. Fairness\nThe rules defined in this document are to be reviewed and agreed upon by the community as a whole. If a rule is unclear, it is to be revised until it is clear. If a member believes that this document is missing any rules or exceptions, the member may request for this modification to be reviewed and agreed upon by the community.\n\nIn the event of a moderator using personal best judgment when dealing with members and punishments, all members have the right to audit said actions and the moderator should provide justification and or seek unanimous approval from the moderation team.\n\n\n\n### 3.8. Appeals\nIf a member believes their punishment is unfair or a mistake, the member can discuss their punishment with the moderation team via ticket.\n\nIf a member has been temporarily or permanently banned from the server and thus cannot create a ticket, the member may reach out directly to the moderation team for appeal.\n\nAppeals currently are managed via Wick and can be accessed at https://appeals.wickbot.com/. You will need to use our server ID \\`(1172245377395728464)\\` to submit an appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Notice\n\nPlease note that this article cannot capture all rules and that each situation needs to be assessed individually. Attempting to exploit any \"loopholes\" within these guidelines is strictly forbidden. \n\nModerator actions may cite rules from this document. Please be aware that section numbers may change over time and may not be the same when the action was issued. Sections referenced do not imply their respective subsections \\`(e.g. citing 1.1 does not imply 1.1.b)\\`.\n\nWe aim to keep you updated whenever these guidelines get revised. However, the responsibility lies with you to upkeep the essence of these rules: to maintain the safety of Discord and uphold its inclusivity. Stay informed about server announcements and polls which might induce changes to the rules. We appreciate your contribution in this regard.\n\nAbove all, exercise good judgment and common sense.",
