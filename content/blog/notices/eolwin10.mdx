EoL (short for End of Life) for Windows 10 doesn’t mean it suddenly stops working. It just won’t receive future updates.

Updates usually provide more features, stability, and continued software support. Personally, we think Windows has already been quite solid for everyday use. So why do updates matter?

Well, connecting to the internet always carries some risk. You expose your device to the wider world, and malicious actors may try to exploit that: whether through direct attacks on your system or by tricking you into giving away sensitive details like bank credentials.

While some risks (like phishing attempts) can be avoided with awareness and caution, operating system vulnerabilities are different. They can only be addressed through patches and updates. Without them, Windows 10 will gradually become less secure.

If you never connect your device to the internet, Windows 10 can still work fine, since the exposure is very limited. But for most people, this is a huge restriction in today’s world.

## What are your options?

We’ll break this down into **Windows Options** and **Non-Windows Options**, assuming you’re keeping your current device.

### Windows Options

1. Upgrade to Windows 11.

2. Check if you can meet the requirements by enabling TPM in your motherboard BIOS. (If this sounds unfamiliar, you may want to skip it.)

3. Bypass Windows 11’s requirements using Rufus and install it anyway.

4. Use custom ISOs like Tiny11.

   > **Note:** Custom ISOs don’t have official Microsoft support and could pose extra security risks. They may miss updates or contain vulnerabilities. Proceed only if you fully understand the trade-offs.

5. Stay on Windows 10 (generally not recommended due to security concerns).

### Non-Windows Options

If you believe Windows is the only way to use a computer, we’d argue that’s not the case. There are plenty of other operating systems, with Linux being the most prominent alternative.

In our experience, most everyday users don’t need the full scope of Windows features. Many popular applications are available on Linux, or at least have strong alternatives. Tools like WINE and Bottles can also help run certain Windows apps.

> For simplicity, we’ll just refer to Linux-based distributions as “Linux.”

Linux comes in many forms (called distributions, or “distros”), but don’t let that overwhelm you. Here are some good starting points:

1. **Linux Mint** (Cinnamon, XFCE, or MATE editions. We suggest Cinnamon if you’re undecided.)
2. **Fedora** (the KDE and Workstations edition are the most polished.)
3. **Ubuntu** (the most well-known option).

In our opinion, Linux Mint is the best starting point for most users. It’s based on Ubuntu but feels easier to use and comes with more useful pre-installed tools. Fedora and Ubuntu are also excellent choices.

## Some clarifications

1. You don’t need to use the terminal to run Linux (though it can be handy).
2. Most mainstream apps are available, but certain specialised or industry-standard software (e.g. Adobe Creative Suite) may not be.
3. Installing apps is, in our view, usually easier and faster than on Windows.
4. Linux often feels faster than Windows because it has less overhead.
5. You can install Linux alongside Windows (though the setup may feel tricky if you’re new to OS installation).
6. Linux tends to be more secure since apps don’t automatically get full system access. You can install them in sandboxed formats like Flatpak, or go the traditional route if you want full access.
7. If you dislike forced updates, Linux gives you full control over when to update: no surprise restarts.

In practice, viruses and malware are rare on Linux, especially for home users. Attackers usually focus on Windows, since it has the largest user base.

So, when Windows 10 reaches End of Life, you have choices. You can stick with Microsoft by moving to Windows 11, or explore the community-driven world of free and open-source software.
