EoL (short for End of Life) Windows 10 doesn't mean it's dead. It just won't receive future updates.

Updates provide more features, stability, and sometimes software support. But Windows is already quite good at it. So why do you need updates?

Well, connecting to the internet poses a security risk. You expose yourself to the world, and bad people may try to exploit you in a number of ways, either by hacking your machine or by tricking you into entering your sensitive credentials, like bank account details.

While you can avoid the latter with common sense, hackers can still find weaknesses/vulnerabilities in Windows and use them. These cannot be avoided by simple common sense, because they are system vulnerabilities. Hence, active updates are necessary to patch newly discovered ones.

If you never connect your device to the internet, Windows 10 is fine as there will be little exposure. However, this is a huge restriction in the modern day.

## What are your options?

This can get very lengthy and hard to decide, so I'll break it down to Windows Options and Non-Windows Options, assuming you are not changing your device.

---

### Windows Options

1. Upgrade to Windows 11.

2. Check if you can fulfill the requirements by enabling TPM in your motherboard BIOS settings. (Skip this if you don't know what this means.)

3. Bypass the Windows 11 requirements using Rufus and install Windows 11.

4. Use custom ISOs like Tiny 11.  

   Note: Custom ISOs may lack official support from Microsoft and could pose security risks, such as missing updates or vulnerabilities. Make sure you understand these risks before proceeding.

5. Stay on Windows 10 (not recommended).

### Non-Windows Options

If you think Windows is the only way you could use a computer, you can't be more wrong. There are a ton of operating systems, with Linux being a prominent option.

Nowadays, an average user doesn't need everything that Windows offers. Many prominent Windows-related apps are available on Linux (or at least a very viable alternative is present). There's also WINE and WinBoat that can make Linux run Windows apps.

> For simplicity, I'm referring to Linux-based distributions as Linux.

Linux offers so many options to choose from (called Linux Distros). So don't be overwhelmed. The following is a list of good starting points for new users:

1. Linux Mint (Cinnamon, XFCE, MATE. Any edition is fine. The difference is only in desktop appearance and features. Choose Cinnamon if you can't decide.)

2. Fedora (choose KDE, but Workstation is also fine.)

3. Ubuntu (the most famous one out of these).

These are all good options, with Linux Mint being the best choice. The differences are minimal, and in my experience, Linux Mint comes with more useful pre-installed features/apps. It is based on Ubuntu but has been much easier overall. A solid choice.

Fedora and Ubuntu are good choices too.

## Some clarifications

1. No, you don't need to use the terminal or command prompt in Linux.

2. Most major software is available, but some specialised or industry-standard applications may not be. This includes Adobe software, for example.

3. Installing apps is much easier and faster than Windows.

4. Linux is usually faster than Windows due to less overhead.

5. You can install Linux alongside Windows (this can be somewhat tricky if you are not used to installing OSes).

6. It's more secure because you don’t need to give administrator permissions for installing every app. You can install them in a restricted environment called Flatpaks (don’t worry, it rarely restricts useful features), or you can do the typical installation if you want the app to have full system access.

7. If you hate forced updates, know that Linux doesn’t do that. Instead, it lets you choose when you want to install them. No forced shutdowns or anything.

Also, viruses and malware are almost non-existent for Linux (at least for home users). Hackers mostly target Windows because they'll get more results from there.

So, pick your operating system and switch to the community of free and open-source software.
