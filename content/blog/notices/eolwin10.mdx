From the 14th of October 2025, Windows 10 will become End of Life (EoL). This means it will no longer receive updates or support from Microsoft. This includes both security updates and feature updates. Your computer may continue to function, but it will become increasingly vulnerable to security risks and software incompatibilities over time.

Updates usually provide more features, stability, and continued software support. Windows 10 has already been stable for everyday use for almost a decade now. So why do updates matter so much to users?

Well, connecting to the internet always carries some risk. You expose your device to the wider world, and malicious actors may try to exploit that: whether through direct attacks on your system or by tricking you into giving away sensitive details.

While some risks (Such as phishing) can be avoided with awareness and caution, operating system vulnerabilities are different. They can only be addressed through official patches and updates. Without them, Windows 10 will gradually become less secure. No matter what mitigations or antivirus solutions you use, such as Windows Defender, your device will always be at a significantly higher risk of compromise.

If you never connect your device to the internet, Windows 10 can still work fine, since the external exposure is very limited. But for most people, this is a huge restriction in today's increasing digital landscape.

## What are your options?

We'll break this down into **Windows Options** and **Non-Windows Options**, assuming you're keeping your current device.

As always, make sure to back up your data before making significant changes to your system. Be that the official Windows upgrade, a clean install, or switching to a different operating system entirely.

### Windows Options

1. Upgrade to Windows 11, this is the so-called "official" method, but it requires compatible hardware. _You can check if your hardware meets the Windows 11 requirements [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/windows-11-requirements)._

2. Utilizing [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) you can create bootable drives for Windows 11 if your device does not support a direct upgrade. _Please be aware that this method is not supported by Microsoft and may lead to instability or data loss._

### Non-Windows Options

There are plenty of other operating systems other than Windows, with Linux being the most prominent alternative for general computing. If you are unfamiliar with any of the terminology used or want to learn more check out our Linux and FOSS wiki at [atl.wiki](https://atl.wiki)!

In our experience, most everyday users don't need the full scope of Windows features. Many popular applications are available on Linux, or at least have strong alternatives. Tools like WINE and Bottles can also help run certain Windows apps.

Linux comes in many forms (called distributions, or “distros”), but don't let that overwhelm you. Here are some good starting points:

**[Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com)**

<div style={{ marginLeft: '2rem' }}>
  Offers the Cinnamon, XFCE, or MATE
  [editions](https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php). We suggest Cinnamon if for
  a polished Windows-like experience or XFCE for older, less powerful generally
  devices predating 2012. Mint is generally considered the most user-friendly
  distro for beginners with extensive documentation and software support online.
  Mint generally has a slower stable update cycle offering older software
  versions than other distributions, this increases its stability and
  reliability for users.
</div>

**[Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org)**

<div style={{ marginLeft: '2rem' }}>
  The [KDE](https://fedoraproject.org/kde/) and
  [Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) editions are the primary
  editions of Fedora. Workstation is the more popular and stable option but KDE
  offers a more Windows-like experience with extra customization options. Fedora
  is backed by Red Hat and IBM with a large community. It updates more
  frequently with newer software available whilst maintaining stability, but you
  may need to get more familiar with Linux to utilize it fully.
</div>

**[Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com)**

<div style={{ marginLeft: '2rem' }}>
  The [GNOME](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) edition is the most popular
  and supported, but the [KDE](https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/) edition is also
  available for a more Windows-like experience with extra customization options.
  Ubuntu offers the best stability and has a large corporate backing ensuring
  its longevity. It has a large community and extensive documentation online.
  Ubuntu also has slower updates than some other distros with older software
  versions, but this increases its stability and reliability for users.
</div>

### Summary

Any of these distributions are good options for beginners, and you can try them out without installing by using a live USB using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) (Windows exclusive) or the [Fedora Media Writer Tool](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/preparing-boot-media/), which you can use it for any distro not just Fedora, you can see a [tutorial on atl.wiki](https://atl.wiki/Guides:Creating_Bootable_Media/Fedora_Media_Writer)! Just select your own `.iso` file and get started. You also can try it out in a virtual machine using software such as VirtualBox. This will let you see how they feel on your hardware before committing to an installation.

In the end whichever option you choose it is your choice and because of the freedom of Linux you can do mostly the same on all distros, so don't worry too much about picking the "right" one. You can always try a different one if you want with no vendor or software lock-in.

## Some extra clarifications about Linux

1. You don't need to use the terminal to run Linux (though it can be handy).
2. Most mainstream apps are available, but certain specialized software (e.g. Adobe or Office 365) may not be.
3. Installing apps is, in our view, usually easier and faster than on Windows through provided tools.
4. Linux often feels faster than Windows because as it has less overhead.
5. You can install Linux alongside Windows (though the setup may feel tricky if you're new to OS installation).
6. If you dislike forced updates, Linux gives you full control over when to update: no surprise restarts.

So, when Windows 10 reaches End of Life, you have choices. You can stick with Microsoft by moving to Windows 11, or explore the community-driven world of free and open-source software.

We invite you to join us at All Things Linux, where we can help you navigate the transition and make the most of your computing experience on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/linux). Come say hello or find support and learn from fellow users in the `#quick-support` and `#support-forum` channels! Our community has heped many users getting started with Linux, we will continue to do so in the future. We hope to see you there!
