# Infrastructure DDoS Report - August 2025

## Executive Summary

Starting on August 3rd, 2025, the All Things Linux infrastructure experienced a series of DDoS attacks that resulted in service disruptions over the following week. This incident report outlines the attack vector, our immediate response, the security improvements implemented, and lessons learned to prevent future occurrences.

## Timeline of Events

### Initial Attack
At roughly 9:45 AM on August 3rd, [atl.wiki](https://atl.wiki) became inaccessible due to a coordinated DDoS attack. The attacker initially presented themselves in our Discord server as someone attempting to help diagnose the issue, while simultaneously continuing their malicious activities against our infrastructure.

### Immediate Response
The malicious user publicly disclosed that our server was directly accessible via its IP address, which they had scraped from an online database. Upon verification of this vulnerability, we immediately implemented emergency mitigations:

- **Cloudflare Security Activation**: Enabled all available Cloudflare security features
- **IP Address Rotation**: Rolled to a new server IP address
- **Firewall Enhancement**: Increased the depth and coverage of our firewall protection
- **Service Restoration**: Achieved service restoration at 12:45 PM after approximately 3 hours of downtime

**No data integrity was compromised** during this incident due to the systems previously being set up to be resilient to handle the infrastructure being degraded.

###  Continued Attacks
At 9:30 PM on August 7th, the same malicious actor began launching waves of DDoS attacks lasting 15 minutes, stopping, then returning 15 minutes later. This pattern continued until 2:00 AM, causing intermittent service availability. This then was repeated over the following 3 days until the migration was completed.

### Migration Begins
From the 8th of August to the 10th of August, we began the migration of services to our new distributed infrastructure to better protect against ongoing attacks. We then implemented all security and anti-DDoS systems as part of our comprehensive infrastructure redesign.

### Migration Completion
On August 14th, we finalized all migrations and implemented extra security protocols and systems. We also gained access to Cloudflare Alexandria protection for our most critical domains, significantly enhancing our defensive capabilities against future attacks.

## Root Cause Analysis

Our investigation revealed that DNS records had been improperly configured at some point, which inadvertently exposed our server's direct IP address. The attacker leveraged this exposed IP to flood our infrastructure with network requests, effectively creating a denial-of-service condition that prevented legitimate access to our services.

## Long-term Security Improvements

Following the initial incident, we developed and began implementing a comprehensive infrastructure redesign focused on DDoS protection and service resilience:

### Security Enhancements
- **Cloudflare Proxy Protection**: Secured all services behind Cloudflare's proxy infrastructure
- **Multi-layered Firewall Strategy**: Implemented both VPS provider firewalls and built-in server firewalls to block all non-Cloudflare traffic
- **SSH Bastion Implementation**: Established secure SSH access protocols via a bastion which has been designed to provide maximum resilience to future attacks
- **Infrastructure Distribution**: Migrated from a single VPS architecture to multiple smaller, distributed servers for improved resilience

### Ongoing Challenges
During the implementation of these security measures, the same malicious actor continued launching similar DDoS attacks against all of our services intermittently, which were still hosted on our main VPS during the migration period. These attacks caused intermittent service availability across our entire platform throughout the following days, prompting us to expedite our migration timeline.

## Resolution and Current Status

### Migration Completion
After about a week, we successfully completed migration of most of our systems to the new distributed infrastructure. However, some services remain offline to ensure they can be properly secured for the future:
- **atl.chat Services**: Temporarily taken offline pending reconfiguration for Cloudflare compatibility
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Currently being restructured for improved efficiency and capability

### Additional Support
We're grateful to have received access to **Cloudflare Alexandria** protection for our most critical domains, significantly enhancing our defensive capabilities against future attacks.

## Lessons Learned and Future Prevention

This incident has strengthened our security posture and provided valuable insights:

1. **DNS Configuration Auditing**: Regular reviews of DNS records to prevent IP exposure
2. **Infrastructure Segmentation**: Distributed architecture provides better resilience against targeted attacks
3. **Multi-layered Defense**: Combined Cloudflare protection with local firewall rules and service host provider firewalls to create robust protection
4. **Incident Response**: Improved coordination between security implementation and service migration

## Security Vulnerability Reporting

If in the future you find a security vulnerability in our infrastructure, we encourage you to report it responsibly. We take security very seriously and appreciate the community's help in identifying potential vulnerabilities.

Please see the Responsible Disclosure section on our [security page](https://allthingslinux.org/security) for more information on how to report vulnerabilities to us. By following these procedures you can help to effectively respond and secure our systems against potential threats.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our sincere gratitude to:
- **Our users** for their patience during the extended service disruptions
- **Community members** who provided advice and assistance during the incident
- **Cloudflare** for their support in protecting our services through the Alexandria program

## Moving Forward

We are now significantly more confident in our infrastructure's resilience against future attacks. This incident, while disruptive, has resulted in a much stronger and more secure platform for all our users. We view this experience as an opportunity to improve our security practices and better serve our community.
