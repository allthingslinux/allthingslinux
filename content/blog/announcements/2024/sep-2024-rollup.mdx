# Introduction

As we transition into September, we reflect on the substantial developments and community growth over the past two months. With new roles, channels, and exciting projects on the horizon, our momentum continues to build.

Here’s an overview of what has unfolded:

## Community Updates

#### New Roles and Icons:

Thanks to `@Juniiii`, our role icons have been fully refreshed to a consistent theme.

Recent role additions also include:

- **Ping Roles**: `@Polls`, `@Support` (notifies when new support forum posts are made)
- **GPU Roles**: `@AMD`, `@Nvidia`, `@Intel`
- **Language Role**: `@Dart`

#### Channel Updates:

- **New Channels**:
  - `#server-meta`: Organizes useful resources, cleaning up our channel list.
  - `#quick-support`: For smaller support requests, formerly `support-chat`.
  - `#media`: A space exclusively for images and videos, similar to ⁠random.
  - `#donors`: Highlights new contributions from Open Collective.

## Staff Changes

We’re thrilled to announce several internal promotions:

- `@tess` promoted to Senior Mod.
- `@arkannon` and `@pocki` promoted to Mod.
- `@bee` and `@estralia` promoted to Junior Mod.

## Technology and Development

#### ATL Tools and IRC/XMPP Status:

Our IRC/XMPP services remain unbridged as per the recent update in our blog [here](https://blog.atl.tools/posts/irc-update-1/).

With that being said, thank you for your ongoing support and donations, which are crucial to maintaining our services and further developing solutions to improve them.

#### Tux Development:
