# Introduction

January has been a phenomenal month for our community, marked by rapid growth and the launch of key projects. Your support and participation set the tone for a remarkable start to the new year.

Let’s look back at what we achieved together:

## Key Milestones

#### 1K Members Achieved:

We reached an outstanding milestone of 1,000 members this month! This achievement underscores our place as one of the fastest-growing Linux communities. Thank you for your continued support and enthusiasm.

With reaching this milestone, we have set a huge goal to reach 10,000 members by the end of the year. Whether we reach this goal or not, we will be proud of all the members we have gained this year.

#### Nitro Boosters:

A big thank you to our `@Boosters` for helping us secure 30 boosts, ensuring we keep our **.gg/linux** vanity URL. Remember, we need 14 boosts at all times to maintain it, so your boosts are always appreciated.

## New Features & Updates

#### New Roles:

We've added several new roles to the server. These include but not limited to: `@Slackware`, `@Asahi`, `@Budgie`, `@Nano`, `@Micro`, `@Helix`, `@Assembly`, `/bin/zsh` & `/bin/bash`.

You can find these roles in the `Channels & Roles` category.

Additionally, we've launched a special `@FOSS Contributor` role for verified contributors in the open-source space.

#### Community Server Initiatives:

We are exploring the start of a dedicated VPS to host various community services. Ideas include XMPP servers, a Pastebin service, Git frontends, and more.

## Community Engagement

#### Web Dev Channel:

We've opened up a new forum channel for web developers to share new libraries, tools, and resources for collaborative learning.

#### Color Roles Voting:

We hosted a poll to choose the community's next color scheme, and continued engagement is encouraged as we roll these updates out.

## Announcements

#### IRC & XMPP Integration:

Since the initial ideation around the VPS discussion, we have been working on our IRC and XMPP servers.

Our IRC and XMPP servers have been properly built and are operational:

- **IRC**: Connect with SSL via irc.atl.tools #general
- **XMPP**: Register at atl.tools, chat in our MUC at conference.atl.tools

Join us in testing these integrations!

#### Mail Server Testing:

We are currently testing a self hosted mail server for the community to use so we have opened up a poll to gauge everyone'sinterest. You can find this poll [here](https://discord.com/channels/1172245377395728464/1172343581495795752/1204809750370320494).

## A Big Thank You
