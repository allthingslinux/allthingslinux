## Community Feedback

#### Share Your Thoughts:

We've opened the `#reviews` channel, inviting our community to share feedback and kind words. Your support brings joy and encourages us to showcase our community‚Äôs success.

## Guidelines Updates

#### New Code of Conduct:

We've made changes to our Code of Conduct to improve clarity and guidance.

In our commitment to maintaining a high quality server, we must emphasize the importance of thoughtful and substantial discourse within our community. Accordingly, content that is considered low-effort/low-quality, including but not limited to messages that lack substantive value or do not encourage meaningful conversation, is prohibited.

This includes "brainrot" which are words or phrases with no substantial value. (an example would be animal sounds, reply chains, and current viral memes).

Please review the latest changes [here](https://github.com/allthingslinux/code-of-conduct?tab=readme-ov-file#22-text-channels).

Here‚Äôs to another month of growth and excitement! üöÄ
