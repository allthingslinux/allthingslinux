# Busy, busy, busy 

Once again, our membership has continued to climb even higher. This month we passed an incredible 14,520 members, and we're now well on our way to the 15,000 mileston - averaging 15,795 messages and 109 hours of VC per day! As always, thank you to each and every one of our members!

# A Fresh Lick of Paint

This month saw the introduction of new and updated colour roles, complete with their hex codes to support our visually impaired users. A small detail, but one that means a lot — accessibility matters, and we’re proud to keep doing all we can to keep our space accessible for all. 

We have also updated the channel descriptions, which should make the server easier to navigate - a big thanks to `@miyu` for the good work! Keep an eye out for some Easter eggs! 

# Holding the Line

This month, we faced down multiple DDoS attacks on our infrastructure, but thanks to the quick work of our team, we stood firm. You can read about it in more detail on our blog post here: https://allthingslinux.org/blog/notices/8-25-ddos. We are pleased to say that we have now migrated and secured our critical infra. We have also deployed our security page, for our members to report any issues you may find with our systems - you can do so here: https://allthingslinux.org/security.  

# New Privacy Channel 

We’ve opened a brand-new Security & Privacy channel — a dedicated space for sharing tips, tools and discussions on keeping your digital presence secure. Dive in, learn something new and help others do the same.

# atl.wiki Official Launch! 

The long-awaited atl.wiki has officially launched! <https://atl.wiki/> is now fully live and ready for action!

Our mission is to provide reliable, informative resources for users of all ability levels interested in Linux and FOSS from guides to informational articles, and so much more! We're looking for editors to write new content and to help tidy up existing pages and make atl.wiki the best Linux/FOSS resource out there! Be you a seasoned veteran, or new to the community you are welcome to come join us and help make atl.wiki an amazing resource for everyone.

[Create your wiki account](<https://atl.wiki/Special:CreateAccount>) and you can just start editing!. If you're not sure how to get started you can check out this [section](<https://atl.wiki/ATL:Contributing#How_YOU_can_Help_the_Wiki>) for ways you can help! 

Almost anything Linux or FOSS-related is welcome as long as it follows our [Guidelines](<https://atl.wiki/ATL:Guidelines>).

You can read more about the changes here: <https://allthingslinux.org/blog/projects/wiki-1-0>.

A big thank you to `@atmois` and everyone else who made this project a reality.


# Looking Ahead

August has certainly not been the easiest, but we're still here and we're still going strong. From tackling challenges head-on to launching projects we've dreamt of, it's really been a packed month.

We appreciate every single one of you. Let’s keep building, together.

See you all in September!
