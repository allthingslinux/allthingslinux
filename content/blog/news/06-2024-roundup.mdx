# Introduction

June has marked a period of significant growth and expansion for our community. From launching new services to embracing generous donations, your continued engagement is the heartbeat of All Things Linux.

Let's explore this month's milestones:

## Key Announcements and Developments

### Community Wiki Initiative:

Weâ€™re exploring the development of a comprehensive resource hub to address frequently asked questions and provide valuable guidance to new and experienced users alike.

Share your ideas and get involved with the planning in the `#wiki-chat` channel. And for those that are familiar with wiki/knowledge-base style platforms, we'd love to hear your input on what we should use - place your vote [here](https://discord.com/channels/1172245377395728464/1172343581495795752/1246879966344249477).

#### Official Minecraft Server Launch:

We are thrilled to announce our new Minecraft 1.20.6 Java Edition server, offering a vanilla survival experience. Request whitelist access for the `mc.atl.tools` server, and enjoy building alongside our community.

## Infrastructure and Services

#### IRC and XMPP Services Reboot:

Our IRC and XMPP servers are live again, now at `irc.atl.chat` and `atl.chat`.

While re-registration is needed, this comes with our newly acquired domain: `atl.chat`, paving the way for exciting systems to come, like a potential Matrix homeserver and more!

### Dotcom Domain Acquisition:

Big news! We are thrilled to announce that we are now the proud owners of the `allthingslinux.com` domain. In true Linux fashion, acquiring this domain was made possible by a generous donation from a long-time Linux enthusiast.

## Community Contributions and Support

#### Donations:

A heartfelt thank you to our donors! We've managed to raise nearly $500 in just one week, our server expenses are fully covered for quite some time and preparations for new services continue.
