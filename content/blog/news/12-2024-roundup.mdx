# Introduction

As we close out the year, December has brought remarkable growth and pivotal updates to the All Things Linux community. We’re thrilled to share recent achievements and plans that set the stage for a prosperous 2025.

Here’s a look at our highlights this month:

## Community Growth

#### 6,000 Members Milestone:

We’ve officially surpassed 6,000 members! A warm welcome to all new members, and a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributes to the ⁠support-forum. Your assistance and dedication are incredibly valued.

## Recent Developments

#### Domain and Infrastructure Enhancements:

### Primary Domain Acquisition

By pure luck or destiny, yet again, we’ve successfully acquired our new primary home for the forseeable future, https://allthingslinux.org/.

Although we also own allthingslinux.com, we felt as a team that this domain reflected our organizational goals and mission stronger. Email migrations from .com to .org are underway, with aliases preserved.

### Resource Partnerships

We've secured significant benefits through partnerships and discounts:

- **Google Workspace**: 2,000 accounts and 100TB of shared space.
- **GitHub**: Advanced features for our projects, including CI/CD time, package storage, codespaces, and more.
- **Canva**: 30 pro accounts at no cost to help with our design needs.
- **Okta for SSO**: 50 accounts at no cost to help with our SSO needs.
- **Discounted Fees**: Lower fees with Stripe and PayPal.

More partnerships are in the works and will be announced soon.

We’ve also set up an official non-profit bank account with US Bank to enhance our financial transparency and efficiency.

## Compliance and Policy Updates

#### Legal Compliance Initiatives:

To effectively safeguard user data and adhere to privacy standards, we’ve introduced new Privacy and Cookie policies, along with updated Terms & Conditions on allthingslinux.org. These steps ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR, CPRA, and LGPD across all platforms.
