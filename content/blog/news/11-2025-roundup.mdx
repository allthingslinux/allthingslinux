# 2 Years of ATL 

This November, on the 9th, we hit 2 years as a community. At almost 9 million messages, this was truly something extraordinary. And for certain, we could not have done it without each and every single one of you. 

## How’s the membership looking?

Growing, as usual. All thanks to our amazing community. 

We’ve got some quick stats for you:

- 17,538 members 
- 9,000,000+ messages (nearly 12,000 messages per day for 730 days!)
- 102 hours of VC per day on average

Still climbing and kicking strong! 

# Management changes

- In Aug 2025, we promoted `@farcotton` to now be acting as our newest Admin.
- In Oct 2025, we appointed a new role of Director of Moderation to `@estralia`.
- We’ve also recently formed an **Events Team** to start planning out routine fun events and activities across the server next year.

# Promoting transparency

- In Jan 2026, we will be releasing a public ledger of all financials.
- You can now view a public roadmap of all ongoing ATL projects here: [Public Roadmap](https://allthingslinux.fibery.io/@public/Public_Roadmap)
- You can now view all ATL assets, like all the cool banners we've had over the past 2 years, here: [ATL Assets](https://github.com/allthingslinux/assets)

# Infrastructure improvements 

- We’ve added some new tools to [atl.tools](https://atl.tools) and improved the website UI slightly.
- We’ve implemented a standard security/reporting policy across our services: [Security Policy](https://allthingslinux.org/security)
- Enhanced internal security via Vaultwarden, Cloudflare Access, Okta, and Tailscale.
- Distributed various services from a central machine to a distributed architecture.
- Converted our code of conduct to be "machine readable" to allow for future integrations of it: [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/allthingslinux/code-of-conduct)
- Soon we will be migrating the atl.tools mail server to a new datacenter provider, completely repolished and documented internally.
- Soon we will be moving to a monorepo/GitOps/IaC-style architecture for all existing and future projects.

# atl.wiki

In Aug 2025, our homegrown wiki, [atl.wiki](https://atl.wiki), had its first 1.0 release! As of today, the wiki has 301 pages, 4,205 edits, and 245 users. We appreciate everyone who has helped contribute and encourage you to get involved. A wiki takes a team, and we believe that we can make this wiki a one-of-a-kind resource for the Linux ecosystem.

# atl.chat

Over the past few months, we've slowly been rebuilding our IRC and XMPP servers to be of the highest quality and compliance. Currently the release of these is blocked by a new project codenamed **Portal**, which we will share more info about in the coming months. You can view the new implementations at [irc.atl.chat](https://github.com/allthingslinux/irc.atl.chat) and [xmpp.atl.chat](https://github.com/allthingslinux/xmpp.atl.chat).

# Tux

Not only has ATL been 2 years in the making, but Tux, our custom Discord bot, has also been in formation across those 2 years. Tux was created on Nov 11th, 2023. As of today, Tux has about 60K lines of code, 3.2K commits, and ~40 contributors. We will soon be releasing [v0.1.0](https://github.com/allthingslinux/tux/tree/v0.1.0) and a polished roadmap. Once that is released, we are calling anyone who is familiar with Python to help contribute and make Tux the greatest open-source Discord bot.

# Mod apps reopened

Lastly, our mod team is currently looking to grow, so we encourage you to apply if you have any desire to help support and keep our community safe. You can find said application and others here: [atl.sh/apply](https://atl.sh/apply)

# Steam group

We now have an official ATL Steam group, and we’d love for you to join - it’s invite only and you can find the link [here](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/allthingslinux). Stay tuned for some potential events in the future *wink wink*!

# Wowie 

Again, from the entire team and me, thank you for supporting All Things Linux. And to all of our Donors, a special thank you for believing in our vision and allowing us to continue building. We couldn't do this without you!

Busy month, wasn’t it?

Let’s take a breather, and we’ll catch you in the next one!
