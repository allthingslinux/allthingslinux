# 2 Years of ATL 

This November, on the 9th, we hit 2 years as a community. At almost 9 million messages, this was truly something extraordinary. And for certain, we could not have done it without each and every single one of you. 

# Management changes

We’re so happy to announce `@estralia` as our very first Director of Moderation - this role is responsible for overseeing the moderation of the server, as well as establishing the team culture, developing new policies and scouting fresh recruits!

We’ve also introduced the Events Team - who will be putting together some awesome new events and experiences - coming soon!

# Infrastructure improvements 

- We’ve added some new bits and bobs to https://atl.tools and spruced up the UI 
- Overhauled internal security via VaultWarden, Cloudfare Access, Okta and Tailscale 
- Distributed various services fro, a central machine to a distributed architecture 
- Converted our Code of Conduct to be more “machine readable” to open up avenues for future integrations of it, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/allthingslinux/code-of-conduct)

# Steam group??

Yes, that’s right! 

We now have an official ATL Steam group, and we’d love for you to join - it’s invite only and you can find the link [here](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/allthingslinux)

Stay tuned for some potential events in the future *wink wink*
