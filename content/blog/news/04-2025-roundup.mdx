# Introduction
April was packed. From explosive growth to infrastructure and policy refinements, this month showcased the strength and direction of the ATL community. Here's the full breakdown.

# Community Growth & Activity
We started April with **8,000 members** and are closing the month at nearly **8,900**, with **over 500 joins in the final week alone**. We’re now averaging **~20,000 messages per day** and over **100 hours of voice chat daily**. That’s serious engagement.

# Public Recognition

### Featured by Brodie Robertson
We were **featured on Brodie Robertson’s channel** in their latest video:  
**“Useful Resources Every New Linux User Needs”**  
[Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxhMA0G2_MA)

This kind of exposure helps us reach even more Linux users and strengthen the community’s presence across platforms.

# Server Structure Overhaul

## Channel Changes
To simplify navigation and improve usability:
- **polls** → archived (Polls now go in ⁠`#random`)
- **wiki category** → cleaned up:
  - `#wiki-changelog` → moved to ⁠`/var/logs`
  - `#wiki-todolist` → archived
  - `#wiki-chat` → moved to ⁠`/home/atl/atl-wiki`
  - `#wiki-news` → archived (Future updates will be in ⁠`#announcements`)
- **Access** archived channels via the `@/mnt/archives` role
- **New role**: `@mnt/logs` which grants public log channel access 
- **New channel**: ⁠`#dj-booth` for music bot use

## Updated Channel Layout
Aimed at reducing clutter in key discussion areas:
- ⁠**#linux** – strictly technical  
- ⁠**#general-tech** – general tech discourse  
- ⁠**#off-topic** – daily chatter, media, non-technical discussions  
- ⁠**#random** – memes, shitposts, light banter  

We’re hoping this helps balance the load and keep **#general-tech** useful and on-topic.

# Wiki Guide Section – Soft Launch
We soft-launched the **Wiki’s Guide section** this month to prep for a full release in May. Expect detailed walkthroughs, curated resources, and user-contributed content to become easier to find and share.

# Code of Conduct Updates
Policy updates rolled out this month:
- **1.7** – Piracy & Penetration Testing  
- **2.3** – Voice Channel Behavior  
- **3.4** – Hard Rules ([Pull Request #40](https://github.com/allthingslinux/code-of-conduct/pull/40))  
- 📄 [Full Code of Conduct](https://allthingslinux.org/code-of-conduct#hard-rules)

# Looking Ahead
April was all about refinement and starting a new phase of our history. As we enter May, we’ll be rolling out the full wiki launch, onboarding new staff, and continuing to scale for growth. Thanks for being here—and for shaping one of the most active and collaborative Linux spaces around.

See you in next month’s roundup.
