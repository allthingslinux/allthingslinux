# Introduction

April was packed. From explosive growth to infrastructure and policy refinements, this month showcased the strength and direction of the ATL community. Here's the full breakdown.

# Community Growth & Activity

We started April with **8,000 members** and are closing the month at nearly **8,900**, with **over 500 joins in the final week alone**. We‚Äôre now averaging **~20,000 messages per day** and over **100 hours of voice chat daily**. That‚Äôs serious engagement.

# Public Recognition

### Featured by Brodie Robertson

We were **featured on Brodie Robertson‚Äôs channel** in their latest video:  
**‚ÄúUseful Resources Every New Linux User Needs‚Äù**

This kind of exposure helps us reach even more Linux users and strengthen the community‚Äôs presence across platforms.

# Server Structure Overhaul

## Channel Changes

To simplify navigation and improve usability:

- **polls** ‚Üí archived (Polls now go in `#random`)
- **wiki category** ‚Üí cleaned up:
  - `#wiki-changelog` ‚Üí moved to `/var/logs`
  - `#wiki-todolist` ‚Üí archived
  - `#wiki-chat` ‚Üí moved to `/home/atl/atl-wiki`
  - `#wiki-news` ‚Üí archived (Future updates will be in `#announcements`)
- **Access** archived channels via the `@/mnt/archives` role
- **New onboarding option**: `Logs` which grants public log channel access
- **New channel**: `#dj-booth` for music bot use

## Updated Channel Layout

Aimed at reducing clutter in key discussion areas:

- **#linux** - strictly linux
- **#general-tech** - general tech discourse
- **#off-topic** - daily chatter, media, non-technical discussions
- **#random** - memes, "spam", light banter

We‚Äôre hoping this helps balance the load and keep **#general-tech** useful and on-topic.

# Wiki Guide Section - Soft Launch

We soft-launched the **Wiki‚Äôs Guide section** this month to prep for a full release in May. Expect detailed walkthroughs, curated resources, and user-contributed content to become easier to find and share.

# Code of Conduct Updates

Policy updates rolled out this month:

- **1.7** - Piracy & Penetration Testing
- **2.3** - Voice Channel Behavior
- **3.4** - Hard Rules ([Pull Request #40](https://github.com/allthingslinux/code-of-conduct/pull/40))
- üìÑ [Full Code of Conduct](https://allthingslinux.org/code-of-conduct#hard-rules)
