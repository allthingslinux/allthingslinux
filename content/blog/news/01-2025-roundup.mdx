# Introduction

January was a big month for our community, with continued expansion, new team members, and exciting projects taking shape. Let’s go over the highlights.

# Growth and Activity

#### More Members, More Engagement

Our community grew from 6,262 to 6,843 members, with an impressive average of 12,500 messages sent daily and an average 50 hours of voice chat activity every day. The discussions and contributions from everyone make this space what it is - thank you!

#### New Moderators on Board

We’re excited to welcome @Glocean, @Electron271 and @Vuks to the moderation team! Their help will ensure the community stays well-managed and welcoming for all.

# Projects Updates

#### ISO Archival Effort
We’re looking for volunteers to support The ISO Archival Project, which focuses on preserving old and obscure operating system ISOs. We have managed to document over 7TB of ISO's so far. If you’re interested in software preservation, this is a great opportunity to contribute. Check out [the thread](https://discord.com/channels/1172245377395728464/1323872482943434762) in our forum for more information!

#### Wiki Upgrade
[atl.wiki](https://atl.wiki) has been updated to MediaWiki 1.43, bringing improvements in performance and functionality. We are doing large internal overhauls to improve the experience for contributors and users as well as introduce new options for information and continue to provide useful and unbiased information for Linux and FOSS users of all abilities.

# Looking Ahead
With January behind us, we’re excited for what’s next. Let’s keep the momentum going and continue making this community an amazing place for Linux and FOSS enthusiasts of all abilities!
