# We need your ideas

Last month, we introduced the Events Team to rustle up some exciting events for the server, starting from January 2026. 

We already have a few ideas in mind, but we’d love to hear your thoughts too — you can fill out a form with your suggestions [here](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/Nqh6n+oiEU2QIVdzgJbl-Mx6eWG2BNvlTGkw+tjV600/)

# Return of the Nix channel?

Nixers amongst you — rejoice!

The `#nix` channel, at the request of our members, has been brought back — have fun endlessly discussing flakes, guys!

# Advent of Code Winner

Congratulations to our winner, `@thebyteslayer`, for coming out on top after 12 grueling challenges!

Also, a big round of applause to our runners-up, `@waaberi` and `@susanthenerd`, for taking 2nd and 3rd place respectively.

# Code of Conduct Rewrite 

With `@aimai` at the helm and some other helping hands, we’ve completed a major rewrite of our Code of Conduct to better reflect our mission. The update focuses on clearer rule definitions, improved guidance around enforcement, and modernization to support our growing community.

The revised Code of Conduct will come into effect on January 1, 2026, which should give everyone time to review the changes. Community feedback is still welcome as we continue to refine the document.

Check out the updated Code of Conduct [here](https://allthingslinux.org/code-of-conduct)
