# Introduction

February has been filled with excitement and growth for our community! From successful events to new roles and servers, there‚Äôs a lot to recap. Thanks to all of your continuous support, our community keeps reaching new heights.

Here‚Äôs everything that happened this month:

## Key Events

#### Super Tux Kart Saturday:

We geared up for another Super Tux Kart Saturday on February 17, 2024, at 12:00 PM! Join us for games throughout the day, and hop in whenever you can. The event can be accessed through the in-game server titled ‚ÄúAll Things Linux.‚Äù

Additionally, we met with the Super Tux Kart discord server and they were kind enough to give us a shoutout on their server and film our event. You can watch the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J2tH8ve9AY).

## Community Enhancements

#### New Channels and Roles:

We've added several new roles to the server. These include but not limited to: `@Fedora Atomic`, `@RHEL`, `@Plan 9`, `@Clojure`, `@/bin/dash`.

Furthermore, we added a special `@Revive` role to help revive chat when it needs some life.

#### New Mod Team Members:

Welcoming `@Eternal` and `@eve` to the moderation team. Thank you for stepping up to support our community!

## Other Updates

#### Music Bots and Scrobbling:

We‚Äôve doubled our music fun with two `@tempo` bots. Plus, Last.fm users can scrobble their tracks through `@fmbot`.

## Reminders

- Get involved in our events and share feedback in the #suggestions channel.
- Reach out if you need any help or have questions about our role offerings.

As we step into March, let's continue embracing and celebrating the Linux spirit that unites us all. Your contributions and enthusiasm are what make this community vibrant and welcoming. Here‚Äôs to more shared successes!

Happy End of February! üéâ
