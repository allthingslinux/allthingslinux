# Introduction

June was a massive month for our community, with continued expansion pushing beyond our goal of 10,000 members, new team members on the systems team and moderation team, and even more exciting projects taking shape. Let’s go over and celebrate this months achievements.

# Growth and Activity

#### More Members, More Engagement

Our community grew from 10,764 to 12,064 members, with an impressive average of 15,001 messages sent daily and an average 93.48 hours of voice chat activity every day. The discussions and contributions from everyone make this space what it is - thank you!

#### New Team Members on Board

We’re excited to welcome `@storm`, `@bghs` and `@Ryna` to the moderation team! We'd also love to welcome back '@Khrozma' after a break! Their help will ensure the community stays well-managed and welcoming for all.

Additionally, we'd like to welcome new Systems team members '@Ela', '@ikci', '@waffles' and '@Clemthealien'. These manage our systems and keep ATL turning!

# Projects Updates

#### Giveaway!

We gave away a Lenovo ThinkPad T14 Gen 3 this month to celebrate reaching 10,000 members! With the winner being '@$name'!

#### Wiki 1.0

Looking ahead, in July, the Wiki is releasing in 1.0! A massive step in our wiki's life as it progresses to being a much bigger wiki!
Remember to contribute to the wiki at atl.wiki!

#### CoC Changes

As usual, we've made some changes to the Code of Conduct which we request you review at https://allthingslinux.org/code-of-conduct.

#### Looking Ahead to July!

July is an exciting month as we move forward! Let's keep it up as we move into July!
