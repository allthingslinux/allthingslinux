# Introduction

March has been one of our busiest months yet—full of backend upgrades, community changes, and public recognition for our in-house projects. Let’s break it all down.

# Community Growth & Activity

We have grown from **7,500 to 8,000 members**, holding strong with an average of **12,000 messages per day** and a new high of over **120 hours of voice chat daily**. Your ongoing engagement makes ATL what it is an active, informed, and collaborative community.

# Stats Platform Relaunch

The **ATL Stats site** is back online at [stats.atl.dev](https://stats.atl.dev/).

- If you leave the server, your data is **automatically removed**.
- You can **opt in** anytime using `s$optin`.
- Full privacy details can be seen on the sites [Privacy Policy](https://stats-backend.atl.dev/privacy)

This brings transparency to our activity levels and helps us understand community trends over time.

# Tux Gets the Spotlight

Our Discord bot, Tux, was featured in a live YouTube stream this month!

- The stream highlighted its recent **Docker refactoring**, thanks to contributors **Ivan and Kyle**.
- Tux was showcased alongside major tools like AgentGPT (33k+ GitHub stars).
- Watch it here: [YouTube Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjjm6ycgygo)
- Check out the repo: [Tux on GitHub](https://github.com/allthingslinux/tux)

We hope this brings more attention to the quality work being done by the community.

# Major Site & Backend Updates

## Website Overhaul

Our main site at [allthingslinux.org](https://allthingslinux.org/) got a facelift:

- New branding and structure
- New forms for staff applications: [Get Involved](https://allthingslinux.org/get-involved)
- Google Forms are deprecated going forward

## Infrastructure

Big strides behind the scenes:

- `@Thanos` joined the systems team
- Monitoring and uptime tracking: [ATL Status](https://status.atl.tools/status/public)
- Public dashboards: [Grafana](https://grafana.atl.tools/public-dashboards/7d4ccf819e1e41e9a2d630dd2ea6eded)
- Self-hosted URL shortener: [atl.sh](https://atl.sh)

## Code of Conduct Revisions

Rule **1.2** has been significantly updated.

Please read it here: [GitHub - Rule 1.2](https://github.com/allthingslinux/code-of-conduct?tab=readme-ov-file#12-concerns-of-age-and-appropriate-conduct).

Updates have also been made to sections 1.1, 1.3, and the Notice.

# Staff & Structure

## Promotions

- `@Atmois` has been promoted up to the role of **Admin Assistant**!

## Departmental Structure

We are also refining our team structure into defined departments:

- Community/Moderation
- Management/Admin
- Creative/Content
- Systems/Development

This helps contributors avoid burnout and focus on what they enjoy most and can do best to help grow and strengthen the community.

## New Channels

- `#⁠projects`: A forum for users to showcase personal work, get feedback, and collaborate.

These additions aim to broaden discussion areas and foster deeper engagement in tooling and workflows.

# Looking Ahead

The first quarter of 2025 has shown us what this community is capable of—growth, adaptability, and technical excellence. In April, we’ll continue refining infrastructure, expanding documentation, and bringing tux to the spotlight.

Thanks for sticking with us. See you next month.
