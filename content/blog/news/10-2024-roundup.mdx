# Introduction

As we step into October, we celebrate the incredible growth and exciting updates that have shaped our community over the past months. With our one-year anniversary just around the corner on November 9th, prepare for more exciting events and announcements.

Let’s dive into this month’s highlights:

## Community Milestones

#### Nearing 5,000 Members:

Our community continues to grow, and as we approach 5,000 members, your support and engagement remain invaluable. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for being part of ATL!

## Recent Updates

#### New Channels:

- `#forum`: A space for off-topic discussions not suitable for dedicated channels. Share and suggest new topics in the `Forum Suggestions` sub forum.
- `#submit-a-report`: Streamlines ticket creation, guiding new members unfamiliar with slash commands.

#### Staff Changes:

- `@atmois`, `@estralia`, and `@bee` promoted to Mod.
- `@owuawo` welcomed as our new Admin Assistant.
- Creative Team formation underway with `@pseudify` and `@juniiii`; applications opening soon.

#### Role Adjustments:

Because we are limited by Discord role limits, we've streamlined roles by merging similar ones to improve organization and reduce clutter.

Merged Roles:

- `@Arch-based`: e.g. EndeavourOS, ArcoLinux, Manjaro
- `@Ubuntu-based`: e.g. Pop!\_OS, Kubuntu, Zorin
- `@Fedora-based`: e.g. Nobara, Kinoite, Silverblue
- `@*BSD`: e.g. FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD
- `@Universal Blue`: e.g. Bazzite, Aurora, Bluefin

## Tux and Minecraft Updates
