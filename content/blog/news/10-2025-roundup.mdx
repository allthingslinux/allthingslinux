# How big has the family gotten this time?

Welcome to October, everyone — we know you like your statistics, so here you go:

- Membership rose to 16,074 members!
- Averaging 15,920 messages and 100 hours of VC per day!

# Come take a look

We’ve opened up our work to our members in true open-source fashion. 

You can now take a look at our live roadmap and objectives via Fibery, which has become our new organizational home. Our increased visibility comes after a quieter few months and is part of our collective staff effort to improve transparency around where time, effort, and your generous donations are going. As this continues to evolve, we hope to continue to build trust and clarity with you moving forward. 

You can view the public roadmap [here](https://allthingslinux.fibery.io/@public)

# Banners, banners, banners

What’s that you say? You wonder where all our old server banners are kept?

Well, you’re in luck! You can browse through our creative banner choices, both old and new, [here](https://github.com/allthingslinux/assets).

Enjoy! 

# And that’s all, folks 

This brings an end to an open, more transparent month at ATL — catch you all in the next one!
