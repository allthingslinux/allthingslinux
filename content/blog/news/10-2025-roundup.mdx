# Come take a look

We’ve opened up our work to our members in true open-source fashion. 

You can now take a look at our live roadmap and objectives via Fibery, which has become our new organisational home. Our increased visiblity comes after some quieter few months and is a prt of our collective staff effort to improve transparency around where time, effort and your generous donations are going. As this continues to evolve, we hope to cointinue to build trust and clarity with you moving fowards.
