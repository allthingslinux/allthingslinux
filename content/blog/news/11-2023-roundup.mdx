# Introduction

As we wrap up an exciting month on our server, let's take a moment to reflect on the developments and key milestones we achieved together. Your enthusiasm and dedication have been incredible, making this community a lively and inclusive space for all Linux enthusiasts.

Here’s what happened in November:

## Key Milestones

#### Acquired discord.gg/linux:

We've acquired the `.gg/linux` discord vanity URL by pure luck. This is a great opportunity for us to grow and expand our community.

#### Membership Growth:

We reached over 200 members and exchanged more than 100,000 messages in just 12 days! A big welcome to all our new members.

#### Top.gg Placement:

We made it to the front page of Top.gg, thanks to your participation in voting and reviews. Keep those bumps coming!

## Server Enhancements

#### Initial Rules Draft:

The first draft of our community rules is now available for viewing and feedback. Your input is valuable to making this community a better place.

**View the draft here:** [All Things Linux v1 Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fb7UtSYmjDqp3Kkm36IK2dk262E2wkbwhYssdoYl4ME/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Ticketing System:

We introduced a ticket system using [Helper.gg](https://helper.gg/), allowing you to report concerns and speak with moderators when needed.

Please use `/ticket` for any issues you may have.

#### Role Updates:

- Added several new roles related to programming, distributions, and desktop environments/window managers.
- Added a wide range of color roles to spice up your profile.
- Standardized all bot prefixes/nicknames for a more streamlined experience.

#### RSS Feeds:

We've added several RSS feeds for the #news channel to help you stay up to date with the latest news in the Linux community.
