# Introduction
February brought even more growth, new features, and major backend improvements to our community. Here’s everything that happened this month.

# Growth and Activity

#### More Members & Engagement
We expanded from 6,900 to 7,500 members, maintaining an active community with over 12,500 messages sent daily and an average of 75 hours of voice chat per day. Thanks to everyone for keeping discussions lively and engaging!

# New Community Features

### Projects Updates
We’ve introduced a new Projects forum to give members a space to showcase their personal projects, receive feedback, and collaborate with others. If you have ideas to improve the forum, check out the pinned thread and share your thoughts!

#### TuxGPT Updates
The @/bin/tuxgpt instance is available to all Level 15+ members, donors, and boosters! Recent updates have improved response quality! Test it out in bot-commands and let us know what you think. Huge thanks to @Jakob for providing the source!

# Major Infrastructure Overhaul
We’re preparing for a full revamp of our backend services, including:
- Separating mail and other critical services to new servers
- Implementing automated backups, better security, and improved monitoring
- Standardising configurations with Ansible, dotfiles, and user groups

We’ll announce scheduled downtime in advance, so stay tuned for updates.

# New Blog Launch
We’re thrilled to announce the launch of our official blog! Our first post explores the power of MDX and the flexibility it brings to our platform.

Moving forward, the blog will cover more than just news—it will become a hub for:
- Guides & tutorials
- Technical deep dives
- Opinions & discussions from community members

To kick things off, we’ve gone through every announcement since the server’s inception and compiled monthly roundups of all major updates. Looking back, it’s amazing to see how far we’ve come in just a year!

# Looking Ahead
With February wrapped up, we’re excited to push forward with even more improvements and community-driven initiatives. Stay involved, share your feedback, and let’s keep making this space even better!
