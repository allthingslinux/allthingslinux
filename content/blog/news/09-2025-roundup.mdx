# Membership status

As per usual, our community continued to expand — we managed to reach the lofty heights of 15,000 members! Hard to imagine just how far we’ve come. 

This month, we averaged around 16,125 messages per day and 117 hours of VC. We also flew past **8 million total messages** — thank you to everyone who helps keep the place buzzing! 🔥

# Anything happening over here?

September proved to be a relatively quiet month by our usual standards. All in all, it was a month of fewer headline moments and continued graft and behind-the-scenes progress to keep pushing towards our community goals.

That’s all from us for now — short and sweet. 

Much love to all of you, see you next month!
