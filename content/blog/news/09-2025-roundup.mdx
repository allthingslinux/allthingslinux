# Membership status 

As per usual, our community continued to expand - we managed to  reach the loft heights of 15,000 members! Hard to imagine just how far we’ve come. 

This month, we managed to average around 16,125 messages per day, and 117 hours of VC!

# Anything happening over here?

September proved to be a relatively quiet month by our usual standards. All in all, it was a month of fewer headline moments and continued graft and behind-the-scenes progress to keep pushing towards our community goals.

That’s all from us for now - short and sweet. 

Much love to all of you, see you next month!
